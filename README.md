## Welcome to Susereum!

Susereum is a Blockchain Based Platform (BBP) that rewards developers for their code contributions. It creates a permanent immutable credit (called Suse) when a contributor changes the codebase for improved sustainability. Susereum is seamlessly integrated with GitHub, Sawtooth Hyperledger, and the code analysis tool SourceMeter. These components and others provide the means to automatically calculate the quality of the code and produce the coding standard within a particular project. Susereum empowers project stakeholders by dynamically redefining sustainability metrics that best characterizetheir project priorities, technologies, and context. Susereum's vision is to establish novel incentive structures to systematically prioritize sustainability.

For more imformation on the architecture, and overall design of Susereum, please consult the wiki.
